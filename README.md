# MapContextControl
Sandbox options to configure what roles can access which map context menu items

This simple mod adds sandbox options which allow you to set which access level (= roles on a Project Zomboid server, such as admin, moderator, gm, ...) can use which right click context menu options when right clicking on the map.

In vanilla, only admins can use the "Teleport Here" right click option, for example. Some servers may want to make this available to their moderators or GMs, and this mod allows you to do just that!
